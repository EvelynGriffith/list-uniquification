# List Uniquification

## Evelyn Griffith

## Program Input and Output

### What is the output from running the following command?

`poetry run datauniquifier --approach dictionary --column 1 --data-file input/data.txt`

```The chosen approach to uniquify the file is: dictionary

The data file that contains the input is: input\data.txt


 The data file contains 50000 data values in it!

Let's do some uniquification!

üîç So, was this an efficient approach to uniquifying the data?

The function 'unique_dictionary' took: 0.0050 sec

Estimated overall memory according to the operating system:
   21.82421875 megabytes

üîç So, did this remove a lot of duplicate data?

   The number of values removed from the data: 49476
   The percent reduction due to uniquification: 98.952
```

### What are the first five lines of the contents of the file that is input into the `datauniquifier`?

```dana74@mahoney-perez.com,"Administrator, charities/voluntary organisations"
nathanjohnson@davila.net,Software engineer
pbush@gmail.com,"Journalist, newspaper"
timothy75@chang.com,Osteopath
gsparks@yahoo.com,"Psychologist, clinical"
```

### What is the output from running the test suite with the command `poetry run task test-silent`?

```collected 11 items

## Source Code

### Describe in detail how your provided source code works

#### Please explain each line of source code from the `extract` module

TODO: Write at least one paragraph to explain the requested source code

```
for line in csv.reader(
    data.splitlines(),
    quotechar='"',
    delimiter=",",
    quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL,
    skipinitialspace=True,
):
```

#### Explain in detail the purpose of the following two Python functions

TODO: Write at least one paragraph to explain the requested source code

```
def calculate_reduction(list_start, list_final):
    """Calculate the reduction in the size of the list."""
    return len(list_start) - len(list_final)


def calculate_percent_reduction(list_start, list_final):
    """Calculate the percent reduction in the size of the list."""
    reduction = calculate_reduction(list_start, list_final)
    percent_reduction = (reduction / len(list_start)) * 100
    return percent_reduction
```

## Explain in detail the purpose of the following Python function

TODO: Your response to this question should explain every line of source code
in the provided function. If you do not initially understand one of the lines
of source code, then please consult online resources or ask a question on
Discord. If you are still not sure how a line of source code works, please use
explain everything that you do understand about that specific line.

```
def timing(function):
    """Define a profiling function for execution time."""
    @wraps(function)
    def wrap(*args, **kw):
        ts = time()
        result = function(*args, **kw)
        te = time()
        print("The function %r took: %2.4f sec" % (function.__name__, te - ts))
        return result

    return wrap
```

### Experimental Results

## Please use output from running the program to explain which Python function is the fastest. How did you know?

TODO: Your response to this question should use concrete numbers that resulted
from running the `datauniquifier` program.

## Please use output from running the program to explain how much list uniquification decreases the size of each column.

TODO: Your response to this question should use concrete numbers that resulted
from running the `datauniquifier` program.
